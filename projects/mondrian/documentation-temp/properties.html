<p> In a scenario where the schema is very large and dimensions have
large number of members a MDX query that has a invalid member in it will
cause mondrian to to go through all the dimensions&shy;,&shy; levels&shy;,&shy; hierarchies&shy;,&shy;
members and properties trying to resolve the element name&shy;.&shy; This behavior
consumes considerable time and resources on the server&shy;.&shy; Setting this
