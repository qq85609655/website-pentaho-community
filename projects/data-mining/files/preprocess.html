<p>The <b>Preprocess Panel</b> has facilities for importing data from a database, a CSV file, or other data file types, and for preprocessing this data using a so-called filtering algorithm. These filters can be used to transform the data (e.g., turning numeric attributes into discrete ones) and make it possible to delete instances and attributes according to specific criteria. </p>
