	The <strong>ARFF Output Plugin</strong> is a tool that allows you to output data from Kettle to a file in WEKA's Attribute Relation File Format (ARFF). ARFF format is essentially the same as comma separated values (CSV) format, except with the addition of meta data on the attributes (fields) in the form of a header. <br>Documentation on this plugin can be found <a href="http://wiki.pentaho.com/display/DATAMINING/Using+the+ARFF+Output+Plugin" target="_blank">here</a>.
