<p>The <b>Classify Panel</b> enables the user to apply classification and regression algorithms (indiscriminately called classifiers in Weka) allowing you to the resulting data set, to estimate the accuracy of the resulting predictive model, and to visualize erroneous predictions, ROC curves, etc., or the model itself (if the model is amenable to visualization like, e.g., a decision tree). </p>
