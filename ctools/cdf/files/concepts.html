<h3 class="mainTitle">Concepts</h3>

<p>This framework provides a standardized way to implement and publish dashboards to the Pentaho Business Intelligence Platform.</p>
<p>The main goal of this framework is to provide the user an easy and friendly way to build dashboards.</p>

<h4>Technical Advantages</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Enforces security via Pentaho's security model;</li>
	<li>Separation between the HTML design and component definition;</li>
	<li>No need to create JSP pages to deliver new Dashboards. The user doesn't need to have the knowledge to deal with that kind of technology;</li>
	<li>Rich list of components: selectors, timeplot charts, tooltips, openstreet maps integration, etc;</li>
	<li>Easy to design - it's all plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript;</li>
	<li>No need to create Pentaho Action Sequences - in most cases, the components are configured using a friendly syntax;</li>
	<li>The Dashboard objects can be easily reused. The behavior of Dashboard objects (components) is related to their parameters values, and so the user may use the same object on a different Dashboard, modifying only the values of one or two parameters;</li>
	<li>Auto refresh and interaction between Dashboard objects. The user doesn't need to concern about interaction between components - the only thing the user must specify is which variable is bound to the object;</li>
	<li>Portlet integration;</li>
	<li>Build your own Dashboard component library. When a particular component with a specific behavior is being used in all your projects, just add it to your JavaScript library for further use.</li>
</ul>
