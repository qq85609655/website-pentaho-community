<h3 class="mainTitle">Templates</h3>

<p>The premise around CDF is to reduce time and effort to make a new Dashboard. Following that objective, the Dashboard template concept was created.</p>

<h4>Main Objectives</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Avoid repeating the same content (Navigation bar, JavaScript libraries, layout, etc) to every Dashboard;</li>
	<li>Avoid the creation of a template file for every solution folder by using a default template.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Template File Types</h4>
<p>The templates are present in the <code>pentaho-solutions</code> directory, under <code>system/pentaho-cdf</code>.</p>
<p>There are a few types of template files used by CDF framework below.</p>

<h4>template-dashboard.html</h4>
<p>This is the outermost template. Usually contains the common layout, header and the navigation bar - all the necessary JavaScript libraries are included automatically.</p>

<h4>template.html</h4>
<p>If this file is present in a solution folder, the Dashboards generator will interpret it and present the contents to the user. All components will be rendered according to the life-cycle described in the components section.</p>

<h4>template-dashboard-mantle.html</h4>
<p>On the supplied samples, this template contains the header and all the necessary JavaScript libraries. The navigation menu was excluded since mantle already has its own navigation approach. </p>

<h4>default-dashboard-template.html</h4>
<p>When no template is present in the current solution folder, this template is presented to the user. It can be used to present a content navigation page.</p>

<p>Two questions are raised here:</p>
<h4>How can we choose between the template-dashboard-mantle and the template-dashboard?</h4>
<p>The answer is simple: just use the style tag in the xcdf file or call RenderHTML with the template request argument (example: <code>template=mantle</code>). For xcdf files the default template to be used is specified in <code>solutions/system/pentaho-cdf/plugin.xml</code>.</p>

<h4>Can I modify the templates?</h4>
<p>Of course, that's the purpose of template files.</p>

<h4>Documenting Projects</h4>
<p>As a consequence of the CDF structure, it can be used to make documentations of project implementations.</p>
<p>The CDF documentation found in the Pentaho server is an example that can easily be extended to other scenarios.</p>
