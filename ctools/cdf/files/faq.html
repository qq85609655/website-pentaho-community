<h3 class="mainTitle">FAQ</h3>

<h4>Are the tutorials a replacement for the CDF documentation?</h4>
<p>No, they aren't. They complement each other.</p>

<h4>I want to learn to design dashboards with CDE. Why should I buy the CDF tutorials?</h4>
<p>CDE uses CDF as the Dashboard engine. In that sense, CDE and CDF are closely related. The understanding of CDF concepts is a great help for understanding and using CDE.</p>

<h4>After using the tutorials, I have some suggestions/issues/questions. Which is the best channel to send you this information and help with the product development?</h4>
<p>The best communication channels are the <a href="http://forums.pentaho.com/" target="_blank">Pentaho Community Forums</a> and the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pentaho" target="_blank">#pentaho channel on Freenode</a>.</p>

<h4>After installing the tutorials, I don't see the dashboards / I only see a blank page / I only get the processing window which runs continuously. What is wrong?</h4>
<p>There are some options:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you followed the instructions you received;</li>
	<li>Make sure the Pentaho version where you installed the tutorial is compatible with the tutorial itself;</li>
	<li>Make sure you installed the tutorials in your root solution folder, not under <code>bi-developers</code>;</li>
	<li>If you're still in troubles, look for errors in the Pentaho logs for a clue.</li>
</ul>
