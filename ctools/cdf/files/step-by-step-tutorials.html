<h3 class="mainTitle">Step-by-step Tutorials</h3>

<p>As the main developers of this community project, we understand that sometimes it isn't easy to achieve exactly what we want.</p>
<p>To allow users to get the full benefit of CDF we've prepared a set of documentation - a step by step tutorial from "how to start" to the hidden features of this framework.</p>

<h4>By doing so you will:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Have the source - so that you can see how everything is built;</li>
	<li>Get free updates made to the tutorial for 1 year;</li>
	<li>Get a refund guarantee if you're not happy with the result;</li>
	<li>Contribute with open-source development.</li>
</ul>
