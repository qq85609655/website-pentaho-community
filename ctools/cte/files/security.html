<h3 class="mainTitle">Security</h3>

<p>CTE takes special care with security, only files for which the user has write permissions can be edited. But on top of that, CTE explicitly denies access to some files:</p>

<ul>
	<li>prpt</li>
	<li>ktr</li>
	<li>kjb</li>
	<li>binary images</li>
	<li>compressed files</li>
</ul>

<p>These settings, and more, can be changed in the <code>system/cte/settings.xml</code> file.</p>
