<h3 class="mainTitle">Overview</h3>

<p>Using Pentaho's distribution packages may be a very fast way to get a quick up and running server. However, one can easily get lost to which changes were made to build the project.</p>
<p>This will be specially painful when we want to upgrade. Also, for collaboration between distinct team members, just sharing the solution's folder isn't enough, as lots of settings get lost.</p>
<p>CBF targets this and other requirements that come from a real world need. By using a predefined directory structure and building Pentaho from source, we have full control over our installation.</p>
