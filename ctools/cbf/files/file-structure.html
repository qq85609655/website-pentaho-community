<h3 class="mainTitle">File Structure</h3>

<p>We need to create a directory where our CBF structure will live. This directory, which I'll call cbf, will have:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The CBF script;</li>
	<li>Pentaho source code;</li>
	<li>Your project directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>The CBF build script is a tweaked <code>build.xml</code> file (download it from the download section). Specific project directories have the format <code>project-&lt;something&gt;</code>. In this example we'll use <code>project-client</code>. So the structure looks like:</p>

<span class="example">CBF DIRECTORY STRUCTURE</span>
<pre>cbf
├── pentaho-1.6
├── pentaho-1.7
├── pentaho-2.0
├── pentaho-3.0
├── pentaho-3.5
├── pentaho-3.5.2
├── pentaho-3.6
├── pentaho-3.7
├── pentaho-3.8
├── project-bare17
├── project-bare20
├── project-bare30
├── project-bare30-training
├── project-bare35
├── project-bare352
├── project-bare36
├── project-bare37
├── project-bare38
└── build.xml</pre>

<h4>Pentaho Source</h4>
<p>Pentaho source can be downloaded using a SVN client. I use command line tool, so it would be something like this:</p>
<pre>svn co svn://source.pentaho.org/svnroot/bi-platform-v2/tags/3.8.0-stable pentaho-3.8</pre>
<p>Alternatively, <code>http</code> instead of <code>svn</code> can be used if you're behind a firewall. You can browse the SVN tree to get other versions, though sometimes it isn't easy to find the correct one.</p>

<h4>Project Client Directory</h4>
<p>This is where we'll put our files. If you're starting a new project, create this from scratch.</p>
<p>You can also start from the Quickstart section for a pre-built structure. You'll end up with something like this:</p>

<span class="example">PROJECT DIRECTORY STRUCTURE</span>
<pre>project-client
├── config
│   ├── build-nelson.properties
│   ├── build-neraka.properties
│   ├── build-paula.properties
│   ├── build-pdpi.properties
│   ├── build-pedro.properties
│   ├── build-tgf.properties
│   └── build.properties
├── patches
│   ├── project-client
│   ├── target-build
│   └── target-dist
└── solution
    ├── MySolution
    ├── admin
    ├── bi-developers
    ├── cdf
    ├── index.properties
    ├── index.xml
    ├── steel-wheels
    └── system</pre>
<p>The directories in italic are generated during the build process. There are 3 main blocks:</p>

<p class="title">Config</p>
<p>Here lives the different configuration files that will control the build process. When executing CBF, we'll pass an option that defines which environment will be used, like <code>-Denv=pedro</code>. In all cases, the <code>build.properties</code> will be read first for common properties and then the specific file will override this values. In this example, the <code>build.properties</code> file will be read followed by <code>build-pedro.properties</code>.</p>
<p>This example was taken from a Webdetails project, so you'll see several files for each person that has worked with it. We could also have separate environment configuration files for deploying to server.</p>

<p class="title">Patches</p>
<p>The patches directory will be used for three purposes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Making changes to the solution/system configuration;</li>
	<li>Patching the server dir (such as adding jars or changing log4j.xml);</li>
	<li>Patching the source (advanced - for changing java files).</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the patches dir you'll often see 3 main directories:</p>
<ul>
	<li>project-client;</li>
	<li>target-build;</li>
	<li>target-dist.</li>
</ul>

<p class="title">Solution</p>
<p>This is our proper solution implementation. Use as many as needed, but take care to avoid changing the <code>admin</code>, <code>bi-developers</code>, <code>steel-wheels</code> and <code>system directories</code>, as they are wiped and copied again during the build process. For changes in these specific directories, use the patches directory.</p>
<p>The directory structure has to obey the CBF structure. <code>project-client</code> has to match your project name. This is an important detail for the patches to be applied correctly. <code>target-build</code> and <code>target-dist</code> are two CBF specific directories. The first one holds the Pentaho source to be compiled and the second is where the server will be installed into. </p>
<p>Here's a real world example that should be easy enough to understand and extend: </p>

<p>By respecting this structure we'll be able to keep our changes to the pentaho installation in a single place. This can then be placed in a VCS and shared with the team. </p>
