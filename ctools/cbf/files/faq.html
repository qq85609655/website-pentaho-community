<p class="title">Build complains about missing xmltask?</p>
<p>You need to download <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xmltask/files/" target="_blank">xmltask.jar</a> and put it in your ant lib directory (e.g.: /usr/share/ant/).</p>

<p class="title">The build fails with a lot of errors on junit. How do I fix it?</p>
<p>Same as with xmltask: you need to put junit.jar in your ant lib dir. This is a requirement since Pentaho 3.8.</p>

<p class="title">Why should I prefer CBF over a pre-compiled version of the Pentaho server?</p>
<p>See the About page and you will find out!</p>
