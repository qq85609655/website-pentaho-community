<h3 class="mainTitle">File Structure</h3>

<p>A project is built on top of a core image. Instead of being a clean install it's meant to replicate a real project's environment.</p>
<p>As a best practice, it should also have a well defined structure that can be stored on a VCS repository.</p>
<p>Projects should be cloned / checked out in to the <code>/projects</code> directory. We recommend every project to be versioned in a different git or svn repository.</p>

<p>All the solution files are going to be automatically imported, including metadata for datasources creation.</p>
<p>The directory _dockerfiles is a special one, you can override the default Dockerfile that's used to build a project image (the file in dockerfiles/buildProject/Dockerfile) and just drop a project specific Dockerfile in that directory using the former one as an example.</p>
<p>Note that you should not change the FROM line, as it will be dynamically replaced. This is what you want for project level configurations, like installing / restoring a specific database, an apache server on front or any fine tuned configurations.</p>
