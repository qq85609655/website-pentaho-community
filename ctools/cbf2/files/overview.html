<h3 class="mainTitle">Overview</h3>

<p>The goal of this project is to quickly spin a working Pentaho server on <a href="https://www.docker.com" class="specialink" target="_blank">Docker</a> containers. This will also provide script utilities to get the client tools.</p>
<p>This is a very useful project, that we used and maintained actively throughout the last decade. It still works, but now we have different paradigms to take into account.</p>
<p>CBF2 is first and foremost, a developer's tool and methodology so we won't make any recommendations on using it in a production environment, Pentaho's stance on this is clearly explained in this <a href="https://support.pentaho.com/hc/en-us/articles/210384343" target="_blank">article</a>.</p>
