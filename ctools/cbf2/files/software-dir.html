<h3 class="mainTitle">The software directory</h3>

<p>This is the main starting point. If you're a Pentaho employee you will have access to using the getBinariesFromBox.sh script, but all the rest of the world can still use this by manually putting the files here.</p>
<p>You should put the official software files under the software/v.v.v directory. It's very important that you follow this 3 number representation.</p>
<p>This works for both CE and EE it's actually works better for EE, since you can also put the patches there and they will be processed. For EE, you should use the official -dist.zip artifacts. For CE, use the normal .zip file.</p>
