<h3 class="mainTitle">Cluster Info</h3>
<p><a class="spacialink" href="http://www.hazelcast.com/" target="_blank">Hazelcast</a> has a very good <a class="spacialink" href="http://www.hazelcast.com/docs/3.0/manual/multi_html/ch16.html" target="blank">Management Center</a>, so it's outside the scope of CDC to re-implement that kind of features.</p>
<p>However, we do support a simple cluster information Dashboard that gives an overview of the state of the nodes.</p>
