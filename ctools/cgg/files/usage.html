<h3 class="mainTitle">Usage</h3>

<p>Open up an existing CDE Dashboard in Edit Mode and press the keyboard shortcut "Shift + G". This will prompt a popup, where you can choose which charts in the Dashboard you want to render as CGG charts.</p>
<br>
<p>When you save the Dashboard, CGG will generate a JavaScript file for each chart chosen in the popup, and will save it in your Pentaho Solution directory. Those JavaScript files are, basically, CCC chart definitions.</p>
