<h3 class="mainTitle">Motivation</h3>

<p>Very often, we want that several questions related to the data could be answered before we noticed it:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Do we have up to date data?</li>
	<li>Can we trust the data?</li>
	<li>How long did the queries take to run?</li>
	<li>Do we have wrong data? (duplicated users in community)</li>
	<li>Be able to validate big chunks of reprocessing</li>
	<li>Did the data format change?</li>
	<li>Is the data stalled? (eg: number of twitter followers not updating)</li>
	<li>Do we have peaks or valleys in the data? (due to double process or no process)</li>
	<li>We need a way to handle known effects. (eg: Christmas dip)</li>
	<li>We need to correlate independent data sources.</li>
	<li>Do we have a big number of 'unknowns'? (tk=1 in DW)</li>
	<li>Do we have clearly wrong rows in resultset? (e.g.: a line there)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>So we decided to build CDV</strong> - a data validator that periodically does a set of tests that answer all the above questions.</p>
