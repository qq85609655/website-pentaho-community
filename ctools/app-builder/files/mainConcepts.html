<h3 class="mainTitle">Main Concepts</h3>


<p>There are two sections when we edit a App Builder application: plugins metadata and elements definition. </p>

<p>The element group is basically composed by two types of elements: Dashboards, for the front-end side of the application, and Endpoints, for the back-end logic.</p>

<h4>Dashboards</h4>
<p>By filtering the Dashboard element types, we'll see how many screens our plugin has. The User Interfaces are generated through <a class="spacialink" href="http://www.webdetails.pt/ctools/cde/" target="_blank">CDE</a>, and we can jump from App Builder to CDE, if we want to edit our dashboard. Exactly like if we were creating a dashboard.</p>

<h4>Endpoints</h4>
<p>In the core of App Builder, we have pluggable support for several element types. The original idea was to support back-end logic in Javascript, JAVA and others, but <a class="spacialink" href="http://www.pentaho.com/product/data-integration" target="_blank">Pentaho Data Integration</a> worked so well out of the box, that we didn't yet feel the need for anything else.</p>

<h4>Documentation</h4>
<p>You can access the <a class="spacialink" href="https://github.com/webdetails/sparkl/blob/master/documentation/spec.md" target="_blank">App Builder Documentation</a>, where we communicate what are the application's Dashboards and Endpoints, their goals, logic, actions and how all these are wrapped up to build a consistent plugin.</p>
