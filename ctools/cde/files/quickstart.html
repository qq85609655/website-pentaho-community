<!-- <h3 class="mainTitle">Quickstart</h3> -->
<h3><span class="product-bullets">01</span> Imagine</h3>
<p>The very first step to consider before starting to build your Dashboard is thinking about how it will look like and how it will behave. Draw a sketch on paper for future reference.</p>

<h3><span class="product-bullets">02</span> Log into the Pentaho User Console, and launch the CDE</h3>
<p>You can launch the editor from the PUC home page, from the PUC menu (File > New > CDE Dashboard), or by clicking on the CDE icon in the PUC toolbar.</p>

<h3><span class="product-bullets">03</span> Save the dashboard</h3>
<p>Give the Dashboard a name and save it in the solution folder of your choice, and then close the Dashboard.</p>

<h3><span class="product-bullets">04</span> Edit the dashboard</h3>
<p>Refresh the console by clicking F5 (or the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + R), find the Dashboard, right-click it and select Edit. The Dashboard editor will appear. </p>

<h3><span class="product-bullets">05</span> Design the Layout</h3>
<p>Select the Layout perspective and define the dashboard layout according to your sketch. </p>

<h3><span class="product-bullets">06</span> Add the datasources</h3>
<p>Select the Datasource perspective and define the datasources that will feed your Dashboard. </p>

<h3><span class="product-bullets">07</span> Add and configure the components</h3>
<p>Select the Component perspective and add the components that make up your Dashboard: the visual elements, the parameters, and eventually some scripts.</p>

<h3><span class="product-bullets">08</span> Preview your work</h3>
<p>Click on Preview regularly to see how your work is progressing. Repeat steps 5-8 until you are satisfied with your final dashboard. Don't forget to save your work from time to time.</p>
