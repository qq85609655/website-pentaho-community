<h3 class="mainTitle">Layout</h3>

<p>Dashboard Layout depends on several standard technologies.<p>
<p>Besides, CDF incorporates <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" target="_blank">Blueprint</a>, a CSS framework which aims to cut down on your development time. Blueprint offers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A rich set of classes which allow flexible layouts;</li>
	<li>A predefined 24-column layout - providing an easy way for building the dashboard layout;</li>
	<li>Cross browser compatibility;</li>
	<li>Good mobile rendering.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Designing the Layout</h4>
<p>A dashboard layout can be created by a simple combination of rows and columns along with some HTML blocks and possibly some images.</p>
<p>You do all this in the Layout perspective. On the top left area you have a main toolbar that allows you to add, move or delete the different building blocks: rows, columns, spaces, HTML blocks and images.</p>
<p>As you build the layout you will see the structure of nested rows and columns below the toolbar. If you select one of the elements on that structure, the properties area on the right is refreshed. This is where you can set up the element as you wish.</p>

<h4>Dimensions</h4>
<p>You can assign the width of a column with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Span size, where you will draw the components;</li>
	<li>Prepend size and Append size to keep some space between columns.</li>
</ul>

<p>While these properties are specified in Blueprint units, the height for the rows has to be supplied in pixels. Because of Blueprint, in every row the sum of Prepend size, Append size and Span size<strong> must be 24</strong>!</p>

<h4>Look and Feel</h4>
<p>In the Layout perspective you may also provide some look and feel properties. For example, you can set up a background color for a certain element and style for the corners of rows and columns. Besides, if you add a CSS resource, you can apply any of the styles defined there to any of the elements in your layout. All you need to do is create a new class into the CSS stylesheet and define its properties, and then just add this class in the desired element's CSS Class property field.</p>
<p>You're also able to use:</p>

<ul>
	<li>HTML to describe Web pages;</li>
	<li>CSS to control the style and layout;</li>
	<li>JavaScript to add interactivity;</li>
	<li>jQuery to simplify all those tasks.</li>
</ul>
