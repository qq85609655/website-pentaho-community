<h4>I'd like to add a SQL query. Which datasource should I select?</h4>
<p>SQL query or SQL over sqlJdbc/Jndi?</p>
<p>You should definitely choose the options inside the SQL Queries category, based on CDA. The Legacy Datasources are there just for compatibility reasons.</p>

<h4>I want to configure a datasource but I don't understand the properties. Is there a documentation somewhere?</h4>
<p>The CDE datasources - not the Legacy ones - rely on CDA. For understanding the different properties just take a look at the <a href="cda.html#documentation" title="CDA Documentation" target="_blank">CDA documentation</a>.</p>

<h4>How do I add a bubble chart in CDE?</h4>
<p>There are no Bubble components in CDE, but you can add a Protovis component with your customized code. In the same way, you can add any kind of Protovis chart not implemented by CCC.</p>

<h4>How do I edit an old dashboard with CDE?</h4>
<p>You can't. For that purpose, you have to edit the xcdf files directly.</p>

<h4>How do I format the legends in my charts?</h4>
<p>The legend properties (color, font, etc.) as well as many other chart features can be changed or setting by defining CCC extension points. You can find this property in the Advanced Properties tab. For more on extension points read the <a href="ccc.html#charts" title="CCC Documentation" target="_blank">CCC documentation</a>. </p>

<h4>I want to add a kind of component not implemented by CDE. Should I contract Webdetails for developing it?</h4>
<p>Sure you can! But there is an alternative: CDE is open, so you're free to develop your own custom components.</p>
