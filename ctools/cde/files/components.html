<h3 class="mainTitle">Components</h3>

<p>The components are the central elements of a dashboard, there are three different kinds:</p>

<h4>Visual Components</h4>
<p>Those are the components that are displayed in your dashboard, including text boxes, tables, charts (pies, bars, timelines, etc.), selectors (radio buttons, date pickers), OLAP views, reports, etc.</p>

<h4>Parameters</h4>
<p>The parameters represent values that are shared by the components. The parameters are essential for the interaction.</p>

<h4>Scripts</h4>
<p>Pieces of JavaScript code that let you customize the look and feel or behavior of other components.</p>

<h4>Adding and Setting up Components</h4>
<p>Whether you need to add a visual component, a parameter or a script, you need to access the Component perspective (in the top right Menu). </p>
<p>From the left menu, expand the category where your component belongs. For example if you want to add a Date input component, expand the category Selects - from the list click the one that interest you.</p>
<p>A new component will be added in the pane, located in the middle of the screen. When you select a component, the right pane displays its properties - it's where you set up the component.</p>
