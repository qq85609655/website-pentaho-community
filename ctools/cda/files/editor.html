<h3 class="mainTitle">Editor</h3>

<p>An embedded editor allows editing CDA files under the scope of the Pentaho server, avoiding the need to use external editors and manually refreshing the solution repository.</p>
<p>This only works on some browsers, like Firefox or Chrome. The editor is called from the URL. Check the example below.</p>

<span class="example">EDITOR URL SAMPLE</span>
<pre>$BASE_URL/pentaho/plugin/cda/api/editFile?path=public/plugin-samples/cda/cdafiles/compoundJoin.cda</pre>

<p>The desired file location is specified in the path argument.</p>
<p>The editor does not allow creating new CDA files. You must manually create a blank CDA file on the solution repository and refresh the solution repository to be able to edit the file.</p>
